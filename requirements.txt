# Predictive Modeling of Chloride Ion Penetration Resistance in Self-Compacting Concrete Using Ensemble Machine Learning Algorithms

## Overview
This repository provides the source code, trained machine learning model, and a graphical user interface (GUI) for predicting the Rapid Chloride Penetration Test (RCPT) values of self-compacting concrete. The framework is based on ensemble machine learning algorithms and is intended to support research and preliminary assessment of concrete durability.

The tool enables RCPT prediction using mix design parameters and curing temperature through a user-friendly interface.

Input Parameters

The GUI accepts the following inputs:

Cement (C1) (kg)

Fly Ash (FA) (kg)

Silica Fume (SF) (kg)

Coarse Aggregate (CA) (kg)

Fine Aggregate (kg)

Water (W) (liter)

Temperature (°C)

Output

Predicted RCPT value (Coulombs)

How to Run the Application

1. Ensure all required libraries are installed.

2. Place the trained model file XGBoost_RCPT.pkl in the same directory as the GUI script.

3. Run the GUI application using:
python rcpt_gui.py

4. Enter the mix design parameters and curing temperature.

5. Click Predict RCPT to obtain the predicted RCPT value.

6. Use Export CSV to save inputs and results.

7. Use Clear Inputs to reset the interface.


Guidelines for Authors and Contributors

Clearly document any changes made to the model, dataset, or interface.

When retraining models, follow consistent data preprocessing and validation procedures.

Hyperparameter optimization should be performed using appropriate cross-validation techniques.

Follow clean coding practices and include comments for clarity.

Any reuse or extension of this work must appropriately cite the original study.

Intended Use and Limitations

The model is trained on experimental data specific to self-compacting concrete.

Predictions are reliable only within the range of the training dataset.

The tool is intended for research and educational purposes and does not replace experimental testing.
